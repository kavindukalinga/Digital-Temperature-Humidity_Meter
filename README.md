## Product Functionality

The system incorporates two displays to provide real-time output to users. Its primary feature includes setting a safe temperature value, triggering an alarm, and activating an LED when the real-time temperature exceeds the predefined safe threshold. Furthermore, the system allows users to easily deactivate the alarm and LED as per their convenience.

## Product Specifications:

DHT11 Sensor: The system is equipped with a reliable and precise DHT11 sensor to measure temperature and humidity levels effectively.

Dual Displays: Two displays are integrated into the system to showcase real-time temperature and humidity readings, ensuring easy accessibility and visibility for users.

Safe Temperature Setting: Users can configure a specific safe temperature threshold according to their requirements. This enables the system to monitor the environment against potential deviations.

Alarm Trigger: When the real-time temperature surpasses the set safe temperature, an audible alarm is automatically triggered to alert users of the unfavorable condition.

LED Indicator: In addition to the alarm, an LED indicator is activated simultaneously with the alarm to provide a visual alert about the temperature breach.

User-Controlled Alarm and LED: Users have the flexibility to turn off the alarm and LED whenever desired, allowing them to manage alerts based on their preferences and situations.

### The Environmental Monitoring System operates as follows:

• The DHT11 sensor continuously captures temperature and humidity data from the environment.

• The system processes the sensor data and displays the real-time readings on the two integrated displays for easy monitoring.

• Users can set their preferred safe temperature value using intuitive controls.

• Once the safe temperature threshold is defined, the system actively monitors the real-time temperature.

• If the real-time temperature exceeds the predetermined safe value, the alarm is triggered, emitting an audible alert.

• Simultaneously, the LED indicator lights up, providing a visual indicator of the temperature breach.

• Users can choose to disable the alarm and LED, allowing them to silence the alerts as per their convenience.
